# Mountain Car

I created this project to implement and experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms. The Mountain Car project is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to drive an underpowered car up a steep hill. This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to solve this problem.

## Project Overview

The Mountain Car environment, provided by OpenAI Gym, consists of a car situated between two mountains. The goal is to drive the car up the mountain on the right, but the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the car must learn to leverage gravity by moving back and forth to build up enough momentum to reach the goal.

## Features

- **Environment Setup:** Initialize the Mountain Car environment using OpenAI Gym.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the Q-learning algorithm.
- **Training:** Train the model over multiple episodes.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model and visualize the results.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenAI Gym, Matplotlib
